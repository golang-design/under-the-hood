This file contains several tricks in tuning styles of the website but keep
the compatabilities of its markdown form.

1. Customized styles

For images, we can use the following snippet, it floats an image to the
right of a page, and specifies its width and margin w.r.t its surrouding texts:

<div class="img-center" style="margin: 0 30px 30px 50px; float: right; max-width: 60%">
<img src="./x.png" />
<strong>title</strong>
</div>

Specifically, the following centers an image:

<div class="img-center" style="margin: 0 auto; max-width: 80%">
<img src="./book/assets/book.png"/>
<strong>title</strong>
</div>

If your title does not looks like centerd on the bottom of your image,
you can use  to sdjust the title position, 
e.g. <strong>title<span style="padding-right:140px"></strong> to 
give more space of the right of your text.

Sometimes, we need put a quote, here is how to do it:

<div class="quote">
<i class="quote-mark fas fa-thumbtack"></i>
<I>
大道至简。
</I></br>
<I>
Simplicity is complicated.
</I></br>
<div class="quote-right">
-- Rob Pike
</div>
</div>

Literature is supported with the following format:

<table class="bib">

<tr>
<td>[XXX, 1999]</td><td>YYY</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>[XXX, 2000]</td><td>YYY</td>
</tr>

</table>

Lastly, here are some useful text symbols that you can copy with:
